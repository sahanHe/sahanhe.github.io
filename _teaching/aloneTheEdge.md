I worked as a lecturer and a demonstrator for the certificate course, initiated by Department of Electronic and Telecommunication, University of Moratuwa.
Through this course, we targeted to educate the audience on the problems on practical implementations of machine learning models in resource constrained enviorenments like edge devices and how to solve this problems. This course was conducted in project oriented manner. [Course Announcement](https://ent.uom.lk/embedded-machine-learning-for-edge-computing/)
